        <h1>Tread Setters Tire Knowledge</h1>
        <p>
            Many people believe that all used tires are bad, this is not true. Finding a good set of used tires can be
            expected to find at good replicable tire resellers such as Tread Setters. It is also important that you
            inspect the tire or (s) before you make the deal. When looking to purchase used tires you should look at
            these three things. The Tread this refers to the depth of the tire which makes contact to the surface of
            the road you are traveling on. This is measured in mm (millimeters). You should also see if there is any
            unusual pattern of wear and or tear in the tire. This can cause vibrations in your drive and a low life span
            of your tires. The second thing you should look at is the sidewalls of the tires. Which is the part of the
            tire that extends from the bead or center wall of the tire. They should be checked for damages which
            include burn marks, cuts and or slits missing chunks, and deep surface cracks.  If there is a dark ring
            around the sidewall this is what we call a run flat tire. This tire was ran flat on the rim of a car and is no
            longer good it will not have a low life span if any. The last thing you should look for in a used tire is the
            bead which is the inside ring of the tire. This is where the rim and the tire meets on your vehicle. If the
            bead is damaged in any way which could be cuts and or nicks this could cause slow leaks in your tires. It
            is best that you find a tire free of bead damage.
