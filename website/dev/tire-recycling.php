            <h1>Tire Recycling</h1>
            <p>
                Here at Tread Setters we believe in properly recycling your used tires. Tire recycling is the process of
                reusing old tires to make new products such as rubber mulch, race tracks, playgrounds and etc.
                Recycling scrap tires is very important and reduces how much energy sources we use on a daily basis.
                Tread Setters works in partnership with major tire recycling plants to properly recycle your old damaged
                used tires with no cost to our retail customers. Tread Setters is doing its part to help the environment.
