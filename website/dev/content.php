                                   Here at Tread Setters we believe in properly recycling your used tires. Tire recycling is the process of
                                   reusing old tires to make new products such as rubber mulch, race tracks, playgrounds and etc.
                                   Recycling scrap tires is very important and reduces how much energy sources we use on a daily basis.
                                   Tread Setters works in partnership with major tire recycling plants to properly recycle your old damaged
                                   used tires with no cost to our retail customers. Tread Setters is doing its part to help the environment.

                         <h1>Tread Setters Tire Knowledge</h1>
                         <p>
                             Many people believe that all used tires are bad, this is not true. Finding a good set of used tires can be
                             expected to find at good replicable tire resellers such as Tread Setters. It is also important that you
                             inspect the tire or (s) before you make the deal. When looking to purchase used tires you should look at
                             these three things. The Tread this refers to the depth of the tire which makes contact to the surface of
                             the road you are traveling on. This is measured in mm (millimeters). You should also see if there is any
                             unusual pattern of wear and or tear in the tire. This can cause vibrations in your drive and a low life span
                             of your tires. The second thing you should look at is the sidewalls of the tires. Which is the part of the
                             tire that extends from the bead or center wall of the tire. They should be checked for damages which
                             include burn marks, cuts and or slits missing chunks, and deep surface cracks.  If there is a dark ring
                             around the sidewall this is what we call a run flat tire. This tire was ran flat on the rim of a car and is no
                             longer good it will not have a low life span if any. The last thing you should look for in a used tire is the
                             bead which is the inside ring of the tire. This is where the rim and the tire meets on your vehicle. If the
                             bead is damaged in any way which could be cuts and or nicks this could cause slow leaks in your tires. It
                             is best that you find a tire free of bead damage.
